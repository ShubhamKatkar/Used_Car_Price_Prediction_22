# Used_Car_Price_Prediction_22 ðŸš™

The focus of this project is on developing machine learning models that can accurately predict the price of a used car based on its features, in order to make informed purchases. We implemented different regression algorithms and evaluated various learning methods on a dataset consisting of the sales price of different manufacturers and models across different cities. Our result shows the score obtained by different models and selects the one which gives the best result for prediction and deploy it using User interface base models in Heroku Cloud.
